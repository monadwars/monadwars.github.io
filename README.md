So this isnt so much a coding project as it is a Collectable Role Playing Card Game (CRPCG?). 

I am using card maker made by NHMK and can be found here:

List of assets:

Alpha RuleBook v0.2.docx = Rulebook intended for end users. If you want to play a game of "Monad Wars" this will be all you need to read.

CCGDesignDocument.doc.docx = Monad Wars design documentation. To be the one stop location to go if you are looking to develop balanced cards. Should change the format to more of a SoP.

Monad Wars_Alpha Rulebook.docx = An attempt to emulate the MtG Rulebook as a skeleton structure for a rulebook.

card db.xlsx = The table contianing all of the current Monad Wars card information. this is used to generate cards in Card Maker Beta 0.98.0.10.

index.html = will use to host a decent enough page.

/Catalyst = The location of all the Catalyst cards.

/Class = The location of all the Class cards.

/Equipment = The location of all the Equipment cards.

/Location = The location of all the Location cards.

/Quest = The location of all the Quest cards.

/Scenario = The location of all the Scenario cards.

/Token = The location of all the Token cards.

/Unit = The location of all the Unit cards
