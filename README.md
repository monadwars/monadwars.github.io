So this isnt so much a coding project as it is a Collectable Role Playing Card Game (CRPCG?). 

I am using card maker made by NHMK and can be found here:

List of assets:

Alpha RuleBook v0.2.pdf = Rulebook intended for end users. If you want to play a game of "Monad Wars" this will be all you need to read.

CCGDesignDocument.doc.docx = Monad Wars design documentation. To be the one stop location to go if you are looking to develop balanced cards. Should change the format to more of a SoP.

card db.xlsx = The table contianing all of the current Monad Wars card information. this is used to generate cards in Card Maker Beta 0.98.0.10.

index.html = will use to host a decent enough page.

/Monad = The location of all the cards for printing.
